# Sclera-TransFuse
For the reason that our follow-up work is still in progress, we have released an original version. 

we propose a novel dual-flow model, named Sclera-TransFuse, as a efficient sclera segmentation method. The paper also introduces a new sclera dataset
named UBIRIS.v3, which is an expansion of the original UBIRIS.v2 dataset. UBIRIS.v3 consists of a total of 683 images, each with a corresponding manually labeled mask
for sclera segmentation. The paper has been submitted for possible publication. the dataset will be publicly available soon.
